# Galaxytoolbar Revived

The aim of the project is to update the discontinued Galaxytoolbar for the newest OGame version.

I've received permission from the original developer Christan Lehmann to continue this project.

This tool was once permitted by Gameforge, but the relaunch will probably need another permit by Gameforge.
